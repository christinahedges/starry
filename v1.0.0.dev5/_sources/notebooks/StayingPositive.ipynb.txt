        "Unfortunately, there's no trivial way of setting the spherical harmonic coefficients to ensure the map intensity is non-negative everywhere. One helpful thing to keep in mind is that the average intensity across the surface does not change when you modify the spherical harmonic coefficients. That's because all spherical harmonics other than $Y_{0,0}$ are perfectly anti-symmetric: for every bright region on the surface, there's an equally dark region on the other side that cancels its contribution to the surface-integrated intensity. What this means is that the magnitude of the spherical harmonic coefficients controls the departure of the intensity from this mean value (which is equal to the intensity of the $Y_{0,0}$ harmonic, $\\frac{1}{\\pi}$). One way to ensure the map is non-negative everywhere is therefore simply to limit the amplitude of all spherical harmonic coefficients to a small value."
